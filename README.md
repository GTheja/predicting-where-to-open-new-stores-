# about project
In this project i mostely used KMeans Clustering.
In This project my main aim is to find the locations for the store.
here I in the project i took 4 clusters randomly 
usually to find clusters we need to use elbow method
from sklearn.metrics I import pairwise_distances_argim(calculate distance between the points)
in this i took 300 samples of data
i used fit to trian data.
after this i assign label based on closet center
finding new center from the means of point
check for convergence  when center is equal to new_center the it is convergent.
